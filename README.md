### Customer-Product-Recommendations
This project aims to develop a real-time recommendation system for an e-commerce platform that suggests products to users based on their recent browsing or purchase history.
The system will use collaborative filtering to analyze user behavior and identify similar users to recommend products they liked or purchased.
It will also implement content-based filtering by analyzing product attributes like categories, features, and descriptions to match them with user preferences. 
The system will process data continuously to provide dynamic, personalized recommendations, improving user engagement and driving sales.
